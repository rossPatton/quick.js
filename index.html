<p>Lightweight, Modular, Isomorphic, DOM Traversal Library</p>

<p>inspired by <a href="https://github.com/bendc/sprint">sprintjs</a>, very rough, use at own risk, etc etc. </p>

<p>goal is to match the functionality (more or less) of <a href="https://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/">jQuery dom manipulation methods</a>, using the latest native methods. Not a library to use if you have to support legacy browsers.</p>

<p>Ideally will work on the server side (like cheerio) as well as the front-end, and will be require-able on a method by method basis like lodash (eventually). Selections are cached by default, and the cache is bustable (props to <a href="http://ttmm.io/tech/selector-caching-jquery/">Eric Mann</a>).</p>

<p>Anything that results in a change to the DOM goes through requestAnimationFrame.</p>

<p>Will have convenience methods for working with data attributes (using css classes as selectors is bad for you).</p>

<p>If you want to contribute, I could use a little help with the isomorphic bits and eventually a little help with testing would be nice.</p>

<p>When coverage hits around 80-90% consider this library 'useable', but changes may still occur.</p>
